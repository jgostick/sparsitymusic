Sparsity creates instrumental and atmospheric rock music built on raw guitar with layers of complexity in the form of synthetic sounds, unexpected chord progressions, odd time signatures, and soaring dynamics. These songs are best appreciated through headphones, in the dark, without interuption. Sparsity is a postrock rock project by Jeff Gostick.
